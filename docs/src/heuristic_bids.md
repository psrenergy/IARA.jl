# From Physical Data to Bid Offers

This document describes the process of transforming physical data from asset owners into bid offers for various unit types, including thermal, renewable, and hydro units. 
Bid offers are calculated using predefined formulas that incorporate operational parameters, risk factors, and specific bidding approaches.


## Asset Owner attributes

- ``I``: Set of assets owners
- ``BG(i)``: Set of Bidding Groups of asset owner $i$
- ``J^T(b, n)``: Set of thermal units of bidding group $b$ and network node $n$.
- ``J^H(b, n)``: Set of hydro units of bidding group $b$ and network node $n$.
- ``J^R(b, n)``: Set of renewable units of bidding group $b$ and network node $n$.
- ``J^{VR}``: Set of virtual reservoirs.
- ``J^H_{VR}(r)``: Set of hydro units associated with virtual reservoir $r$.
- ``I_{VR}(r)``: Set of asset owners associated with virtual reservoir $r$.
- ``K^{VR}(r, i)``: Set of segment offers at virtual reservoir $r$ for the asset owner $i$.
- ``E^{VR}_{r,i}(\omega)``: Energy stock of asset owner $i$ on virtual reservoir $r$ at scenario $\omega$.
- ``F(b)`` Set of risk factors for bidding group $b$.
- ``F^{AO}(i)`` Set of risk factors for asset owner $i$.
- ``p_f``: Risk factor.
- ``s_f``: proportion of the risk factor $r$ in the bidding group $b$.
- ``e_{r,i}``: participation of asset owner $i$ in virtual reservoir $r$.
- ``B(t)``: Set of subperiods in period $t$.

## Parameters

- ``d(\tau)``: Duration in hours of subperiod $\tau$.

## Thermal Units

The bid offers for thermal units are based on their maximum generation and operational costs. 
The maximum generation $\overline{G}^T_j$ and om cost $\overline{C}^T_j$ are converted to bid offers by using the following formula:

```math
\begin{align}
Q_{i, n, \tau, k}(\omega) &= s_f \cdot \overline{G}^T_j \cdot d(\tau) &\quad \forall k = (j - 1) \cdot |F(b)| + f, f \in F(b), j \in J^T(b, n)  \\
P_{i, n, \tau, k}(\omega) &= (1 + p_f) \cdot \overline{C}^T_j &\quad \forall k = (j - 1) \cdot |F(b)| + f, f \in F(b), j \in J^T(b, n)
\end{align}
```

Where:
- $Q_{i, n, \tau, k}(\omega)$  represents the bid offer in segment $k$ for energy quantity in period $\tau$, calculated by multiplying the unit’s maximum generation $\overline{G}^T_j$, the duration of the subperiod $d(\tau)$, and the proportion of the risk factor $s_f$.
- $P_{i, n, \tau, k}(\omega)$ represents the bid offer in segment $k$ for price, calculated by applying a risk factor $p_f$ to the operational cost $\overline{C}^T_j$.

The bid offers are calculated for each thermal unit $j$ in bidding group $b$ and network node $n$ and bid segment $k$.
Each segment represents a combination of thermal unit and risk factor, so the number of segments is the product of the number of thermal units and the number of risk factors in the bidding group.

Note: Other thermal unit attributes are not considered when forming these bid offers.

## Renewable Units

For renewable units, the conversion incorporates the maximum generation $G^R_j$, the realized generation $G^R_{j, \tau}(\omega)$ and om cost $\overline{C}^R_j$ are converted to bid offers by using the following formula:

```math
\begin{align}
Q_{i, n, \tau, k}(\omega) &= s_f \cdot G^R_{j, \tau}(\omega)\cdot G^R_j \cdot d(\tau) &\quad \forall k = (j - 1) \cdot |F(b)| + f, f \in F(b), j \in J^R(b, n)  \\
P_{i, n, \tau, k}(\omega) &= (1 + p_f) \cdot \overline{C}^R_j &\quad \forall k = (j - 1) \cdot |F(b)| + f, f \in F(b), j \in J^R(b, n)
\end{align}
```

The renewable unit bid offers follows the same structure as thermal units, with the exception that the energy quantity is calculated using the realized generation $G^R_{j, \tau}(\omega)$ instead of the maximum generation.

## Hydro Units

Hydro unit bid offers are derived from a Minimum Cost Run, where the generation output $g^H_{j, \tau}$ and opportunity cost $\pi^H_{j, \tau}$ are converted into bids. Two approaches are available:

### Indepedent Bids

For hydro units submitting independent bids, the conversion is performed using the following formulas:

```math
\begin{align}
Q_{j, n, \tau, k}(\omega) &= s_f \cdot g^H_{j, \tau}(\omega) &\quad \forall k = (j - 1) \cdot |F(b)| + f, f \in F(b), j \in J^H(b, n)  \\
P_{j, n, \tau, k}(\omega) &= (1 + p_f) \cdot \pi^H_{j, \tau} &\quad \forall k = (j - 1) \cdot |F(b)| + f, f \in F(b), j \in J^H(b, n)
\end{align}
```

In the Independent Bids approach, it has the same structure as thermal and renewable units, with the exception that the energy quantity is calculated using the generation output $g^H_{j, \tau}(\omega)$ instead of the maximum generation. This is just a simplification of the bid offer calculation. 

### Virtual Reservoirs

For hydro units in a virtual reservoir, the conversion is performed using the following formulas:

```math
\begin{align}
e_{r,i} &= \frac{E^{VR}_{r,i}(\omega)}{\sum_{l \in I_{VR}(r)} E^{VR}_{r,l}(\omega)} &\quad \forall i \in I_{VR}(r), r \in J^{VR}\\
Q^{VR}_{r, i, k}(\omega) &= e_{r,i} \cdot s_f \cdot \sum_{\tau \in B(t)} g^H_{j, \tau}(\omega) &\quad \forall k = (j - 1) \cdot |F^{AO}(i)| + f, f \in F^{AO}(a), j \in J^H_{VR}(r), i \in I_{VR}(r), r \in J^{VR}  \\
P^{VR}_{r, i, k}(\omega) &= (1 + p_f) \cdot  \frac{1}{\sum_{\tau \in B(t)} d(\tau)} \sum_{\tau \in B(t)} \pi^H_{j, \tau} d(\tau) &\quad \forall k = (j - 1) \cdot |F^{AO}(i)| + f, f \in F^{AO}(a), j \in J^H_{VR}(r), i \in I_{VR}(r), r \in J^{VR}  \\
\end{align}
```

In the Virtual Reservoir approach, the energy stock of asset owner $i$ in virtual reservoir $r$ is used to calculate the participation $e_{r,i}$, which represents the proportion of the total energy stock that the asset owner controls.

Using this participation factor, the asset owner $i$ can submit bid energy offers for segment $k$, which are based on the generation outputs $g^H_{j, \tau}(\omega)$ for all hydro units in the virtual reservoir and across all risk factors $F^{AO}(i)$ of the asset owner.
The energy bid offer is scaled according to the asset owner's participation factor, $e_{r,i}$, in the virtual reservoir.

The price offer is calculated by taking the average opportunity cost $\pi^H_{j, \tau}$ across the subperiods $\tau$ in period $t$, with the weighting of each subperiod’s duration $d(\tau)$, and applying the risk factor $p_f$ to adjust the price offer accordingly.
