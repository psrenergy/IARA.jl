## Unit Conventions
- Energy (generation, offers, deficit, curtailment, battery storage): Generally in MWh and converted to GWh for the outputs.
- Demand: GWh
- Volume: hm³
- Water flow (inflow, turbining, spillage, minimum outflow): hm³, converted to m³/s for the outputs, and read as m³/s for the inputs.
- Ramp: MW/min
- Price per energy (deficit cost, price offer): $/MWh
- Energy flow in the network: MW
- Water costs: $/hm³
- Objective function: k$
