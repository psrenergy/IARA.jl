IARA is open-source software for analyzing electricity market design choices and price formation schemes and their consequences for agents' strategies for participating in these markets.

## Funding 

The code development was funded by the project [**Meta II Formação de Preço**](https://www.meta2formacaodepreco.com.br/), "A study about short-term electric energy price formation: an analysis of the Brazilian market".

This project was funded with resources from [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) made viable by initiative of the Brazilian [Ministry of Mines and Energy](https://www.gov.br/mme/pt-br).

Execution of the project was carried out under the leadership and supervision of the Brazilian electricity market operator [CCEE](https://www.ccee.org.br/), with activities and development being led by [PSR](https://www.psr-inc.com/en/).
