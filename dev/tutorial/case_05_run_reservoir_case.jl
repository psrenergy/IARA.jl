# ## Case recap

# In the [previous section](case_05_build_reservoir_case.md), we have built a case containing a virtual reservoir with two hydro units and two asset owners. Now, we will run this case in the `MARKET_CLEARING` mode.
# Now we will run this case using the `MARKET_CLEARING` mode.

# As we have Hydro Units in this case, we need the hydro generation and hydro opportunity cost time series files. We can automatically generate them by running the case with the `TRAIN_MIN_COST` mode.
# We will be doing this before running the case in the `MARKET_CLEARING` mode.

# Let's create a folder to store the output of the `MARKET_CLEARING` mode and define the path to the original case.

const PATH_ORIGINAL = joinpath(@__DIR__, "data", "case_5")
const PATH_EXECUTION = joinpath(@__DIR__, "case_5_execution")

if !isdir(PATH_EXECUTION)
    mkdir(PATH_EXECUTION)
end

cp(PATH_ORIGINAL, PATH_EXECUTION; force = true);
#hide

# ## Executing

# ## Adding Hydro time series

# Now we are able to run the case with [`IARA.train_min_cost`](@ref).

IARA.train_min_cost(PATH_EXECUTION)

# After that, we have to move the hydro generation and hydro opportunity cost time series files to the `case_5_execution` folder.

hydro_generation_file = joinpath(
    PATH_EXECUTION,
    "outputs", "hydro_generation.csv",
)
hydro_opportunity_cost_file = joinpath(
    PATH_EXECUTION,
    "outputs", "hydro_opportunity_cost.csv",
)

hydro_generation_destination =
    joinpath(PATH_EXECUTION, "hydro_generation.csv")
hydro_opportunity_cost_destination =
    joinpath(PATH_EXECUTION, "hydro_opportunity_cost.csv")

mv(hydro_generation_file, hydro_generation_destination; force = true)
mv(
    hydro_opportunity_cost_file,
    hydro_opportunity_cost_destination;
    force = true,
);
#hide

# After that, the hydro generation and hydro opportunity cost time series files will be automatically linked to our case.
# Now we are ready to run the case in the `MARKET_CLEARING` mode.

# As we need to set the run mode to `MARKET_CLEARING`, we need to open the study again.

# ### Analyzing the results

# The results are stored inside the case folder, in the `outputs` directory.

# ```
# case_folder
#  ├── outputs
#  │    ├── plots

#  │    └── ...
#  └── ...
# ```

# According to our results, for the first bid segment, there is more energy generated by the first Asset Owner, which is related to their bidding prices differences.
# The second bid segment has a similar behavior, with the the first asset owner decreasing its energy generation probably due to the decrease in the hydro volume.

# ```

# Also, the volume from the first hydro unit starts at 100 hm³, and as the energy decreases, the volume decreases as well. The second Hydro unit starts with 0 hm³ and increases over time

# ```

# Finally, as the second hydro unit has a higher O&M cost, it is only dispatched when the energy from the first hydro unit is not enough to meet the demand.
