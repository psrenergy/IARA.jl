# IARA

## Installation Guide

IARA.jl is a Julia package that can be installed using the Julia package manager. First, if you do not have Julia installed, you can download it from the [official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/). If you are using Julia for the first time, you can follow the [Getting Started](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/) guide.

To install IARA.jl, you can run the following command in the Julia REPL:

```julia
using Pkg

Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/psrenergy/IARA.jl")
```

This will install the package and its dependencies. You can then use the package by running:

```julia
using IARA
```
