# IARA community standards

IARA is part of the Julia community, and we follow its [community
standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/). We repeat some of the main points
here, but please read the full document for more details.

## Be respectful and inclusive

Please do not use overtly sexual language or imagery. Do not attack anyone based on any aspect of personal identity, including gender, sexuality, politics, religion, ethnicity, race, age, or ability. Keep in mind that what you write or say in public forums is read or heard by many people who don't know you personally, so please refrain from making prejudiced or sexual jokes and comments – even ones that you might consider acceptable in private. Ask yourself if a comment or statement might make someone feel unwelcomed or like an outsider.

## Give credit

All participants in the Julia community are expected to respect copyright laws and ethical attribution standards. This applies to both code and written materials, such as documentation or blog posts. Materials that violate the law, are plagiaristic, or ethically dubious in some way will be removed from officially-maintained lists of resources.

## Get involved

The Julia community is built on a foundation of reciprocity and collaboration. Be aware that most community members contribute on a voluntary basis, so ideas and bug reports are ok, but demands are not. Pull requests are always welcomed – see the [contributing guide](https://psrenergy.github.io/IARA.jl/dev/contributing.html) to read about how to get started.
